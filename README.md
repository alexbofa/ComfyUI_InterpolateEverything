# ComfyUI_InterpolateEverything
Custom nodes for interpolating between, well, everything in the Stable Diffusion ComfyUI.

Current functionality: 
* Create a preprocessed ControlNet OpenPose input midway between two input images.

To install:
Don't, yet. Currently relies on a lot of copy-pasted code from https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfy_controlnet_preprocessors, and contains none of the environment setup tools from that one. Next update is planned to reorganize things so that comfy_controlnet_preprocessors is a dependency.
